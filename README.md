Pull data from google analytics

Requires a google service-account authentication file and a request json file to run. See `report-request.json` file for an example of what the request should look like. More documentation can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/rest/v4/reports/batchGet). As for the service account file, the documentation is a bit difficult to navigate but [this](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/quickstart/service-py) is a good starting point.

Good documentation for google analytics metrics & dimensions can be found [here](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/dimensions-metrics-explorer/)
